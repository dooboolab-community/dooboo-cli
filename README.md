## Announcement

The new CLI tool, dooboo, is now available and can be used with the [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npx) command as shown.
```sh
npx dooboo init
```

We've decided to streamline our project development and focus our efforts on a single codebase and tool, Expo :rocket:. Given that Expo provides extensive support for Android, iOS, and web platforms, we see it as the most effective solution for our requirements. As a result, we're planning to deprecate our React Native and React projects :tada:. You can learn more about Expo [here](https://expo.io).

In addition, we're shifting our approach with the [`dooboo-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dooboo-cli). We're no longer maintaining the global installation of `dooboo-cli` and are instead focusing solely on its package accessible through `npx`. This move ensures more streamlined code execution and reduces potential compatibility issues.
